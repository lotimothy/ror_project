At my kid's elementary school, there are often activities and events that need parents involvement and support. Every few weeks, teachers are emailing out to all the parents their needs for chaperones for trips, organizers for activities, or supplies for those special events. Parents generally respond by email (reply all) to sign up, and sometimes there are sign-up sheets posted in the classroom where people can physically sign up.

The problem is, it's really hard to keep track of who has signed up for what. Unless you pay attention to each individual email, or the teacher continually sends out new emails with updated lists of needs and things fulfilled, it can get pretty confusing. Not to mention that the in-classroom sign-up sheet is a duplicate of what's online, and not always synced. On top of that, when people change their mind or cancel, it can be a logistical nightmare keeping track of it all.

This app was designed to be easily integrated with a school's website. It provides a simple way that teachers and parents can log in and create events, list out the needs for events, sign up to meet those needs, or change responses. And given that most parents are receiving and responding to the initial email announcing needs on their phone, I designed this to be mobile-friendly.
